When launching a token project, it's critical that you get it in front of as many eyes as possible. Our core team has been building in Web 3 for over 2 years and actively investing and networking for almost 10 years. Part of the BBC Launchpad experience includes mentorship in how to connect with alpha callers, influencers and other social promoters, spaces hosts, and community collaboration.

## Alpha Callers

One of the most critical elements in any token launch strategy is identifying influential "alpha callers" -- people who run Telegram or Discord groups and alert their communities to upcoming launches that have potential. We'll provide a list of high quality alpha callers and make intros as necessary if your project passes BBC DAO vetting.

## Social Influencers

We've attending weekly spaces with and built relationships with some of the biggest social influencers in Web 3. We'll help you understand influencer marketing, engagement marketing, and many other aspects of building an audience one Twitter and other social media. Depending on the potential of your project, we may also make intros to influencers and promoters or provide you with a list of folks to reach out to.

## Spaces Hosts

Twitter spaces is a good way to differentiate your project. Too many project founders hide behind their keyboard and communicate verbally with their community. Those that do tend to build more cohesive, loyal communities that are in it for the longer haul. We know some of the top Spaces hosts in Web 3.

## Community Collabs

Another cricital element in launching a sustainable token project is community collabs. This includes collabs with both token projects and NFT projects. We'll mentor you on collab techniques and help set up secure airdrops for communities you want to collab with.
