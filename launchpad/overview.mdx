The BBC Launchpad is a community-driven IDO launchpad with extensive blockchain experience, engineering infrastructure, and Web 3 connections. Our DAO launches many of its own token projects and also vets and advises entrepreneuers interested in launching their own. Leverage our automated deployment machinery and Web 3 connections to get your project off to a strong start.

If you're a Web 3 entrepreneur planning to launch a new token soon, apply to the BBC Launchpad. Your project will be presented to our community as a DAO proposal and if it gains sufficient community support, you'll get the full support of the BBC Think Tank with your launch.

Our IDO launchpad offers founders many engineering and marketing benefits, including deployment of your token, pre-sale contract, airdrop contract, and staking contract. We also help advise on tokenomics, assist with the creation of your LP pool, and provide marketing support.

Launchpad applicants must burn BBC tokens to initiate the application process and burn additional tokens to deploy the various contracts required by their project. All projects launched through the BBC Launchpad are subject to community vetting and must offer an airdrop allocation to $BBC holders in their tokenomics.
