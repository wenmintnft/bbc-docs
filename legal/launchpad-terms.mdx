The Billionaire Blockchain Club Launchpad (“BBC Launchpad”, “we,” “us,” or “our”) is a wholly owned subsidary of WenMint, Inc. We welcome you. 

Your access to and use of our launch pad platform (the “Platform”), our Discord servers (the “Discord Channels”), and your white-labeled presale site, if applicable (each, a Presale Site”) are governed by these terms and conditions of service (these “Terms of Service”). These Terms of Service also contain terms and conditions of sale (the “Terms of Sale”) which govern transactions that occur on our Platform. The Terms of Sale are incorporated into and made a part of these Terms of Service. Our provision of access to and use of the Platform, Discord Channels, and Presale Sites are collectively referred to herein as our “Services.” By clicking “I Accept” or by browsing the public areas of the Services or accessing and using the Services, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be legally bound by the terms and conditions of these Terms of Service and the terms and conditions of our Privacy Policy (the “Privacy Policy”), which is hereby incorporated by reference and made a part of these Terms of Service. We may update these Terms of Service from time to time, and if you accept the modified terms or otherwise access or use any of the Services after such modified terms go into effect, you will be deemed to have agreed to the modified terms. If you do not agree to any of these terms, then you are not permitted to use the Services.

THE SECTIONS BELOW TITLED “BINDING ARBITRATION” AND “CLASS ACTION WAIVER” CONTAIN A BINDING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER. THEY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS. PLEASE READ THEM CAREFULLY.

1. DESCRIPTION OF OUR SERVICES; ELIGIBILITY; USERS OF OUR SERVICES
The Platform is a no-code launch pad service that automates almost all aspects of launching and running an non-fungible token (“NFT”) collection on any blockchain. Our Services enable the launch of such NFT collections on a user-dedicated, white-labeled Presale Site. BBC’s Discord Channels, hosted on the communication platform Discord, foster community and serve as a forum where users can chat with BBC about the creation and launch of their NFT collections and activity on their Presale Sites. In addition to these Terms of Service, your use of our Discord Channels is subject to the terms and conditions of Discord’s platform (the “Discord Terms”). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these Terms of Services, BBC reserves the right to deactivate any user’s access to the Platform, Discord Channels, or dedicated Presale Sites at any time, including, without limitation, if we determine that you have violated these Terms of Service or any Discord Terms.

The Services are available only to individuals aged 18 years or older. If you are 18 or older, but under the age of majority in your jurisdiction, you should review these Terms of Service with your parent or guardian to make sure that you and your parent or guardian understand it. If you are under the age of 18, you may use the Services only with the consent of your parent or guardian. We reserve the right, in our sole and absolute discretion, to deny you access to the Services, or any portion thereof, including by closing or disconnecting your account, without notice and without reason. In order to gain access to our Platform, Discord Channels, and any dedicated Presale Sites we create for you, you must first (i) contact our team so that we may conduct an internal review of your project and ensure that it is the right fit for BBC and so that we may direct our third-party service providers to perform all necessary KYC and background checks, and (ii) purchase an NFT directly from BBC on the Platform which acts as your launch pass, enabling you to launch your NFT collection, create your Presale Site, and start selling your NFTs (a “Launch Pass”). Launch Passes must be purchased on our Platform, and such purchase is subject to our Terms of Sale.

2. COMMUNITY GUIDELINES
By accessing and/or using the Services, you agree to comply with the following community guidelines (the “Community Guidelines”):

You will only access the Services if you are age eighteen (18) or over; users over age eighteen (18) but under the age of majority in their jurisdiction must have permission from a parent or guardian to access and use the Services, and a parent or guardian must accept these Terms of Service on behalf of the minor;
You will comply with all applicable laws relating to your use of the Services and will not use the Services for any unlawful, deceptive, or fraudulent purpose;
You will not provide to BBC, or upload, post, e-mail, transmit, or otherwise make available to or through the Services, any Customer Materials (as defined below) that:
infringes any copyright, trademark, right of publicity, or other proprietary rights of any person or entity; or
is defamatory, libelous, indecent, obscene, pornographic, sexually explicit, invasive of another’s privacy, promotes violence, or contains hate speech (i.e., speech that attacks or demeans a group based on race or ethnic origin, religion, disability, gender, age, veteran status, and/or sexual orientation/gender identity); or

You will not cover, obscure, block, or in any way interfere with any advertisements and/or safety features (e.g., report abuse button) on the Services;
You will not use any robot, spider, scraper, or other automated means to access the Services for any purpose without our express written permission; provided, however, we grant the operators of public search engines permission to use spiders to copy materials from the public portions of the Services for the sole purpose of and solely to the extent necessary for creating publicly-available searchable indices of the materials, but not caches or archives of such materials;
You will not reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to discern the source code, algorithms, file formats, or interface protocols of the Platform or any Presale Site, or make the Services, Platform, or any Presale Site available on a “service bureau” basis, or remove or modify any proprietary markings or restrictive legends placed on the Platform or any Presale Site;
You will not take any action that imposes or may impose (in our sole discretion) an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our technical infrastructure; and
You will not take any action that otherwise involves or results in the wrongful seizure or receipt of any NFTs or other digital assets, including purchase or transfer of NFTs by illegal means.
We have the right, but not the obligation, to review and reject or remove content that, in our sole discretion, does not adhere to these Community Guidelines. We also reserve the right, in our sole and absolute discretion, to deny you access to the Platform, our Discord Channels, or Presale Sites, or to any portion thereof, for any reason with or without notice. We may, at our sole and absolute discretion, without notice or liability to you, and without limiting any of our other rights or remedies at law or in equity, immediately suspend or terminate your user account.

3. WHITE-LABELED PRESALE SITES
Once you have purchased and minted a Launch Pass on our Platform, we will begin creation of a dedicated Presale Site from which you can launch your first collection of NFTs. Your Presale Site will be hosted by BBC or on our behalf by our third-party service providers. BBC will implement your Presale Site promptly upon your purchase of the Launch Pass; provided, however, that implementation of your Presale Site may depend upon your cooperation, including your remittance of certain materials to BBC Launchpad relating to your NFT collection (“Customer Materials”).

Your Presale Site shall at all times be managed and operated by BBC Launchpad, however, you will also have access to the back-end of your Presale Site in order to make changes at your discretion, through a dashboard on our Platform. If you require any changes to your Presale Site that you are unable to make on your own, please contact us and we will use commercially reasonable efforts to make such changes.

BBC Launchpad requires that all Presale Sites contain terms and conditions of service, similar to these Terms of Service. It is your responsibility to provide BBC Launchpad with such terms and conditions (the “Presale Site Terms”). As a condition precedent for each individual who visits a Presale Site to purchase an NFT from you, you shall require such individual to acknowledge and accept the Presale Site Terms. All Presale Site Terms shall, at minimum: (i) contain provisions as protective of BBC Launchpad, the BBC Launchpad Content, and the Launch Passes (and their related Content) as those provisions set forth in these Terms of Service including, without limitation, Section 5, Section 9, Section 10, and Section 12 below; (ii) prohibit the sale of any NFT to any purchaser or transferee that is (a) located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a terrorist-supporting country; or is (b) listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties; and (iii) name BBC Launchpad as an express, intended, third-party beneficiary of the Presale Site Terms, with the right to enforce its intellectual property rights thereunder directly against the applicable end-user of the Presale Site. You shall not make any representations, warranties, or other statements in the Presale Site Terms or otherwise concerning BBC Launchpad, the Launch Passes, or the Services, unless otherwise authorized in writing by BBC Launchpad in each instance.

4. TERMS OF SALE
These Terms of Sale govern your purchase of a Launch Pass from the Platform and are in addition to, and not in lieu of, the Terms of Service.
(A) Connecting Your Wallet; Purchasing a Launch Pass
In order to purchase a Launch Pass, you must connect the Platform to your electronic wallet (a “Wallet”). Such Wallets allow you to purchase, store, and engage in transactions using cryptocurrency. When you link your Wallet, you understand and agree that you are solely responsible for maintaining the security of your Wallet and your control over any Wallet-related authentication credentials, private or public cryptocurrency keys, NFTs or cryptocurrencies that are stored in or are accessible through your Wallet. Any unauthorized access to your Wallet by third parties could result in the loss or theft of Launch Passes and/or funds held in your Wallet and any associated wallets, including any linked financial information such as bank account(s) or credit card(s). BBC Launchpad is not responsible for managing and maintaining the security of your Wallet, and BBC Launchpad has no responsibility or liability to you for any unauthorized access to or use of your Wallet or if you are unable to locate your credentials. If you notice any unauthorized or suspicious activity in your Wallet that seems to be related to the Services, please notify us immediately.

Transactions that take place on the Platform are managed and confirmed on the blockchain. When each Launch Pass is sold to you, the agreement for sale is between BBC Launchpad and you, the initial purchaser. You understand that your applicable blockchain public address will be made publicly visible whenever you engage in a transaction on the Platform. You are required to pay our list price for the Launch Pass, which we may update from time to time by posting it to the Platform. BBC Launchpad has the right to reverse the sale of any Launch Pass, at any time, in our sole and exclusive discretion. If we reverse such a transaction, we will issue you a refund for your purchase of the Launch Pass.

(B) Fees; Payment Processing
In addition to the price of the Launch Passes as set forth on the Platform, you may be charged certain processing and transaction fees including, without limitation, Platform transaction fees, payment processing fees, blockchain-related fees, and taxes. You will be solely responsible to pay any and all taxes, duties, and assessments (except taxes on our net income) now or hereafter claimed or imposed by any governmental authority associated with your purchase of a Launch Pass.

By placing an order for a Launch Pass through the Platform, you agree that you are submitting a binding offer to purchase such NFT, you agree to pay all applicable fees associated with the purchase, and you authorize BBC Launchpad, or our third-party payment processor (the “Payment Processor”), to automatically charge and collect such fees from your payment instrument or Wallet.

(C) Ownership of the Launch Pass
When you purchase a Launch Pass, you become the owner of the NFT authenticating and evidencing your ownership in such Launch Pass, but excluding ownership in and to the underlying content in the Launch Pass (the “Content”).

BBC Launchpad and our licensors own and shall retain all right, title, and interest in and to the Content. Upon your purchase of a Launch Pass, BBC Launchpad and our licensors hereby grant to you a worldwide, non-exclusive, perpetual, royalty-free license to use, copy, and display the Content in connection with the Launch Pass and in accordance with the terms set forth herein. All rights to the Content are hereby expressly reserved by BBC Launchpad and our licensors.


Ownership of a Launch Pass is administered entirely on the blockchain. You may not auction, sell, trade, gift, transfer, or otherwise dispose of (“Transfer”) your Launch Pass, either on the Platform or on any third-party platform. If you attempt to Transfer your Launch Pass, ownership in the Launch Pass shall not confer any rights in or on the subsequent transferee, and such transferee shall not be entitled to any of the Services hereunder by virtue of purchasing such Launch Pass via the Transfer. Only initial purchasers of Launch Passes are entitled to access and use our Services.

5. SELLING YOUR NFT COLLECTION ON AND THROUGH YOUR PRESALE SITE
Once we have created and implemented a Presale Site on your behalf, you may use the Presale Site to launch your NFT collection(s), and offer your NFTs for sale to purchasers.

BBC Launchpad is not a party to any agreement between you and any NFT purchaser, and BBC Launchpad has no responsibility with respect to any such transaction. BBC Launchpad will not be liable for the acts or omissions of any third parties, nor will BBC Launchpad be liable for any damage that you may suffer as a result of your transactions or any other interaction with any third parties. Any NFT sales made on your Presale Site will be subject to these Terms of Service and the Presale Site Terms.

6. BBC CONTENT

9. ASSUMPTION OF RISKS RELATED TO NFTS AND BLOCKCHAIN
Volatility:
The prices and liquidity of NFTs are extremely volatile and subjective, and may be subject to large fluctuations. NFTs have no inherent or intrinsic value. Fluctuations in the price of other digital assets could materially and adversely affect the value of your NFTs, which may also be subject to significant price volatility.

Legislative and regulatory changes or actions at the state, federal, or international level may adversely affect the use, transfer, exchange, and value of NFTs. NFTs are not legal tender and are not backed by any government. Transactions of NFTs may be irreversible, and, accordingly, losses due to fraudulent or accidental transactions may not be recoverable. Some transactions of NFTs shall be deemed to be made when recorded on a public ledger, which is not necessarily the date or time that you initiated the transaction. The value of NFTs may be derived from the continued willingness of market participants to exchange fiat currency or digital assets for NFTs, which may result in the potential for permanent and total loss of value of a particular NFT. BBC Launchpad does not guarantee that any NFT purchased or sold through the Services will obtain or retain value, as the value of NFTs is inherently subjective, and factors occurring outside of our control may materially impact the value and desirability of any particular NFT. An NFT is not, and should not be treated as, an investment asset, and is not intended for investment purposes.
Inherent Risks:
There are inherent risks associated with using NFTs, including, but not limited to, the risk of hardware, software and Internet connections, the risk of malicious software introduction, and the risk that third parties may obtain unauthorized access to information stored within an individual’s Wallet. The regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies and tokens is uncertain, and new regulations or policies may materially adversely affect the potential utility or value of the Digital Collectibles. ANY DIGITAL COLLECTIBLE YOU PURCHASE, OR ANY TRANSFER OF A DIGITAL COLLECTIBLE YOU MAKE, ACCEPT OR FACILITATE, WHETHER INSIDE OR OUTSIDE OF THE SERVICES, WILL BE ENTIRELY AT YOUR RISK. BBC LAUNCHPAD DOES NOT CONTROL OR ENDORSE TRANSFERS OF NFTS.

You agree and understand that you are solely responsible for determining the nature, potential value, suitability, and appropriateness of these risks for yourself, and that we do not give advice or recommendations regarding NFTs, including the suitability and appropriateness of, and investment strategies for, NFTs. You agree and understand that you access and use the Services at your own risk; however, this brief statement does not disclose all of the risks associated with NFTs and other digital assets. You agree and understand that BBC Launchpad will not be responsible for any communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions or delays you may experience when using NFTs, however caused.

Use of Blockchain:
NFTs exist only by virtue of the ownership record maintained on the applicable blockchain. With respect to Launch Passes (NFTs sold by BBC Launchpad), we may store the Launch Passes on our own servers or those of third-party service providers. Any transfer of NFTs facilitated by the Services occurs within the blockchain and not on the Platform or through any of our Services.

IF YOU PURCHASE A LAUNCH PASS, YOU ACCEPT AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT BBC LAUNCHPAD WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY COMMUNICATION FAILURES, DISRUPTIONS, ERRORS, DISTORTIONS OR DELAYS YOU MAY EXPERIENCE WHEN USING THE SERVICES, ANY THIRD-PARTY PLATFORM, OR THE BLOCKCHAIN, HOWEVER CAUSED. UPGRADES TO THE SERVICES, ANY THIRD-PARTY PLATFORM, OR THE BLOCKCHAIN, OR A CHANGE IN HOW TRANSACTIONS ARE CONFIRMED ON THE BLOCKCHAIN MAY HAVE UNINTENDED, ADVERSE EFFECTS ON YOUR NFT.

The Launch Passes are intangible digital assets that exist only by virtue of the ownership record maintained in the blockchain. All smart contracts are conducted and occur on the decentralized ledger within the blockchain. BBC LAUNCHPAD HAS NO CONTROL OVER AND MAKES NO GUARANTEES OR PROMISES WITH RESPECT TO SMART CONTRACTS. BBC LAUNCHPAD IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR LOSSES DUE TO BLOCKCHAINS, OR ANY ELECTRONIC WALLET, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, LATE REPORT BY DEVELOPERS OR REPRESENTATIVES (OR NO REPORT AT ALL) OF ANY ISSUES WITH THE BLOCKCHAIN, INCLUDING FORKS, TECHNICAL NODE ISSUES, OR ANY OTHER ISSUES HAVING FUND LOSSES AS A RESULT.

BBC LAUNCHPAD WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY LOSSES YOU INCUR AS THE RESULT OF YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES, ANY THIRD-PARTY PLATFORM, THE BLOCKCHAIN, OR YOUR ELECTRONIC WALLET, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY LOSSES, DAMAGES OR CLAIMS ARISING FROM: (I) USER ERROR, SUCH AS FORGOTTEN PASSWORDS OR INCORRECTLY CONSTRUED SMART CONTRACTS OR OTHER TRANSACTIONS; (II) SERVER FAILURE OR DATA LOSS; (III) CORRUPTED WALLET FILES; OR (IV) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS OR ACTIVITIES BY THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, VIRUSES, PHISHING, BRUTE-FORCING OR OTHER MEANS OF ATTACK AGAINST THE SERVICES, ANY THIRD-PARTY PLATFORM, THE BLOCKCHAIN, OR ANY ELECTRONIC WALLET.

10. EXTERNAL SERVICES
The Services may contain links to third-party websites including, without limitation, Third-Party Platforms (“External Sites”). These links are provided solely as a convenience to you and not as an endorsement by us of the content or products available through such External Sites. The External Sites may offer third-party goods and services (the “Third Party Products”), and you acknowledge and agree that: (i) we do not manufacture, produce, or sell the Third Party Products and thus have no control over the quality, safety, legality or efficacy of any Third Party Product; (ii) we have no involvement in any transaction involving any Third Party Products; and (iii) we shall have no liability with respect to any Third Party Product or any transaction or interaction between you and the provider of any Third Party Product.

You should contact the site administrator or webmaster for those External Sites if you have any concerns regarding such links or any content located on such External Sites. We are not responsible for the content of any linked External Sites and do not make any representations regarding the content or accuracy of materials on such External Sites. You should take precautions when downloading files from all websites to protect your computer from viruses and other destructive programs. If you decide to access linked External Sites, you do so at your own risk.

11. INDEMNIFICATION
You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold us and our officers, directors, employees, successors, licensees, and assigns harmless from and against any claims, actions, or demands, including, without limitation, reasonable legal and accounting fees, arising or resulting from (i) breach of any of your representations, warranties or other obligations under these Terms of Service; (ii) your misuse of the Services; (iii) your gross negligence or willful misconduct; (iv) any transaction that you enter into with another user of the Services; or (v) any actual or alleged infringement or misappropriation of third party intellectual property rights by any content provided by you to the Services. We shall provide notice to you of any such claim, suit, or proceeding and shall assist you, at your expense, in defending any such claim, suit, or proceeding. We reserve the right, at your expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter that is subject to indemnification under this section. In such case, you agree to cooperate with any reasonable requests assisting our defense of such matter.

12. COMMUNICATIONS WITH US
Although we encourage you to communicate with us, whether via our Discord Channels, email, social media, or any other method of communication, we do not want you to, and you should not, send us any content that contains confidential information. With respect to all communications you send to us, including, but not limited to, feedback, questions, comments, suggestions, and the like, we shall be free to use any ideas, concepts, know-how, or techniques contained in your communications for any purpose whatsoever, including but not limited to, the development, production, and marketing of products and services that incorporate such information without compensation or attribution to you.

13. COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS
The Services are based in the United States. We make no claims concerning whether any content may be downloaded, viewed, or be appropriate for use outside of the United States. If you access or use the Services from outside of the United States, you do so at your own risk. Whether inside or outside of the United States, you are solely responsible for ensuring compliance with the laws of your specific jurisdiction.

14. TERMINATION
We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to terminate these Terms or Service and/or restrict, suspend, or terminate your access to all or any part of the Services, at any time and for any reason without prior notice or liability. We reserve the right to change, suspend, or discontinue all or any part of the Services at any time without prior notice or liability.

15. BINDING ARBITRATION
Subject to Section 17 below, in the event of a dispute arising under or relating to these Terms of Service (“Dispute”), either party may elect to finally and exclusively resolve the dispute by binding arbitration governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”). Any election to arbitrate, at any time, shall be final and binding on the other party. IF EITHER PARTY CHOOSES ARBITRATION, NEITHER PARTY SHALL HAVE THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE SUCH CLAIM IN COURT OR TO HAVE A JURY TRIAL, EXCEPT EITHER PARTY MAY BRING ITS CLAIM IN ITS LOCAL SMALL CLAIMS COURT, IF PERMITTED BY THAT SMALL CLAIMS COURT RULES AND IF WITHIN SUCH COURT’S JURISDICTION. ARBITRATION IS DIFFERENT FROM COURT, AND DISCOVERY AND APPEAL RIGHTS MAY ALSO BE LIMITED IN ARBITRATION. All disputes will be resolved before a neutral arbitrator selected jointly by the parties, whose decision will be final, except for a limited right of appeal under the FAA. The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted by JAMS pursuant to its then current Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures and in accordance with the Expedited Procedures in those rules, or, where appropriate, pursuant to JAMS’ Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures. All applicable JAMS’ rules and procedures are available at the JAMS website www.jamsadr.com. Each party will be responsible for paying any JAMS filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with JAMS rules. Judgment on the arbitrator’s award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. This clause shall not preclude parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or online. If conducted in person, the arbitration shall take place in the United States county where you reside. The parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, to stay a proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator. The parties shall cooperate in good faith in the voluntary and informal exchange of all non-privileged documents and other information (including electronically stored information) relevant to the Dispute immediately after commencement of the arbitration.

16. CLASS ACTION WAIVER
