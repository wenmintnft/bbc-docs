Earn BBC tokens by adding liquidity to the BBC/WETH V2 liquidity pool and staking your LP tokens. Additionally, you'll earn 0.3% of all trades on this pair proportional to your share of the pool.

Providing liquidity to token projects is one of the most underrated ways to quickly make money in crypto. It's also a way to gradually sell off tokens in the early days of a token launch without creating downward pressure on price.

The more liquidity a token has pooled, the less volatile the price. Achieving "deep liquidity" should be a goal of every token project, and this is the purpose of our liquidity staking program.

You can provide BBC/WETH V2 liquidity on Uniswap to earn trading fees and then stake your LP tokens to earn additional BBC rewards.

Our liquidity staking program is powered by TryRoll, whose contracts are audited by Certik. There is no lockup required. You can stake, unstake, and claim rewards at any time. During our first staking campaign, 5% of the BBC token supply will be awarded over a 90-day period with an APY proportional to your share in the staking pool.
