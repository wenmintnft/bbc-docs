Join the BBC to gain early access to a constant stream of token launch opportunities. BBC holders can burn $BBC tokens to gain airdrop access to BBC Launchpad projects. Launchpad projects come in two forms: (1) internal projects proposed by the BBC Think Tank, an operating team within the BBC DAO and (2) external projects presented to the community from entrepreneurs who apply for access to the BBC Launchpad and wish to leverage the BBC's engineering infrastructure and connections.

All launchpad projects (internal and external) are vetted by BBC DAO members. Proposals that gain sufficient community support will be launched.

Those who wish to apply to the BBC Launchpad must burn BBC to initiate the application process. All projects launched through the BBC Launchpad must offer an airdrop allocation to $BBC holders in their tokenomics.
