We've established a staking program to reward HODLers. We've incorporated buy and sell taxes in order to, among other things, implement buybacks from time to time and replenish the staking pool with new tokens. This will help holders replace the tokens they occasionally burn to gain access to airdrops.

Our staking program is powered by TryRoll, whose contracts are audited by Certik. There is no lockup required. You can stake, unstake, and claim rewards at any time. During our first staking campaign, 5% of the BBC token supply will be awarded over a 90-day period with an APY proportional to your share in the staking pool. Staking will go live on the day of launch.
